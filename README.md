A beautiful website to showcase photos. Practicing Next.js and brushing up my css skills.

### Some diary/notes

> I'll update this if I'm feeling the need to... so that I can tell my grandchildren that I wrote this and learn, rather than just blindly follow a tutorial.

1. In the tutorial, we need to import font using `<link href="your-google-font-url" />` and put it in `<head>` tag, just like the way that we all familiar. But in Next.js, I remembered there's an optimized way using [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and it is recommended to use variable fonts. I have no idea what it is. But as soon as I tried the optimized variable font thing, I realized that I can change the font weight using tailwind classes even though I didn't import all those different font weights from Google Font. Pretty cool.

2. Theo is my idol, and he talked about [tailwind tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBajvZaWLXs). One of the thing that interest me is [automatic class sorting with Prettier](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier). Wish I never forget this tips everytime I uses tailwind in my projects.

3. To create a new page in Next.js 13, you need to make sure the file named `page.tsx`? That's kinda lame. I prefer `index.tsx`.
